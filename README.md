## General Information
This corporation stands as the premier online loan marketplace, facilitating a range of financial services including personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures. Borrowers benefit from easy access to loans at lower interest rates through a streamlined online interface. Similar to many other lending institutions, extending loans to 'risky' applicants poses the greatest financial risk, resulting in what is termed as credit loss. Credit loss refers to the funds lost by the lender when borrowers fail to repay or abscond with the owed funds. In essence, those customers classified as 'charged-off' represent the defaulters causing the most significant financial losses to the lenders.

## Conclusions
Lending Club ought to decrease the availability of high-interest loans with a 60-month tenure as they are susceptible to default.
Grades serve as a valuable metric for identifying potential defaulters. Lending Club should scrutinize additional borrower information, particularly for those with low grades (G to A), before approving loans.
To maximize profits, Lending Club should regulate the issuance of loans to borrowers from California (CA), Florida (FL), and New York (NY).
Small business loans exhibit a higher default rate. Lending Club should either cease or reduce the issuance of loans to small businesses.
Borrowers with mortgage home ownership tend to request higher loan amounts and default on approved loans. Lending Club should refrain from granting loans to this category when the requested loan amount exceeds $12,000.
Individuals with a greater number of public derogatory records are more likely to file for bankruptcy. Lending Club should ensure that borrowers have no public derogatory records on file.
